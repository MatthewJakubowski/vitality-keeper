# 🧬 VITALITY KEEPER

> "Don't fix the code. Fix the biology running the code."

**Vitality Keeper** is a somatic logic gate written in Python (Object-Oriented). It bridges the gap between biological telemetry and developer environment access.

### 🏛️ The Philosophy
In high-stakes environments (like Clinical Labs or Deep Tech), a fatigued operator is a liability.
This tool acts as a **Bio-Firewall**. It forces the user to input key biological metrics (HR, Sleep, Stress) before starting a coding session.

**The Logic:**
* High HRV + 8h Sleep = **GOD_MODE** (Authorization for Architecture/Deep Work).
* High Stress + Low Sleep = **LOCKED** (Forced Recovery Protocol).

### 📱 The Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.x (Standard Library)
* **Architecture:** Class-Based (BioSystem), Modular, API-Ready Stubs.
* **Environment:** Mobile Native (Samsung DeX Ecosystem).
* **Output:** CLI Report + HTML Dashboard + Flat-file Audit Log.

### 🚀 Usage
```bash
python vitality_keeper.py
```
  1 Enter your biological data.

  ​2. Receive your Bio-Capacity Score.

  ​3. Check dashboard.html for visual confirmation.
